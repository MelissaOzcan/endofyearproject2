/* 
hello this file is pseudocode
so
i hope ur ready kids

so what we gotta do is collect the data from the user right
so what im thinking is
we make the schedule in the constructor of the file
so the schedule is an object
but thats like a lot of parameters for an array to take right
SO WHAT WE DO IS MAKE AN ARRAY
AND STORE THE USER INFO IN THE ARRAY
THEN THE ARRAYS CAN BE TAKEN AS PARAMETERS
AND WE GOT TWO OPTIONS FOR WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE ARRAYS
WE CAN HAVE FIVE ONE DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS (ONE FOR EACH DAY OF THE WEEk)
OR 
WE CAN HAVE ONE TWO DIMENSIONAL ARRAY !!!
WHICH WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF THE TWO OTHER ARRAYS

as for the actual pseudocode :
we gotta get the input from the user
heres the input that we need to get from the user:

class name
teacher name
room number
VERY IMPORTANT: HOW MANY MODS THE CLASS IS
^^ THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
HOWEVER MANY MODS THE CLASS IS
YOU CAN COPY THE INFO FOR ALL THE MODS
THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE SHOOT
OK SO U ENTER THE INFO STARTING WITH MONDAY AND YOU INPUT THE INFO FOR ONE MOD AT A TIME
BECAUSE CLASSES SPAN FROM 2-4 MODS
BUT IF THE CLASS IS 4 MODS WHY INPUT THAT INFO TWICE
THIS CAN BE A FOR LOOP
IF MODS IS AN INT VALUE
THE FOR LOOP RUNS UNTIL MODS AND ADDS THE INFO FOR THE CLASS INTO THE ARRAY
